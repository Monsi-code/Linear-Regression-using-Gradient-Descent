# Linear-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent
Assuming that you have a set of data going on, and you want to build the machine that look into the data, plotting it on the graph, and then drawing a function that will further predict the value of the data is going to be.

We are going to perform this using pre-knowledge like: y = mx+b, and gradient descent
