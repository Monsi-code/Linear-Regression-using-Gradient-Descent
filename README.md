# Linear-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent
Assuming that you have a set of data going on, and you want to build the machine that look into the data, plotting it on the graph, and then drawing a function that will further predict the value of the data is going to be.

We are going to perform this using pre-knowledge like: y = mx+b, and gradient descent

# The tutorial for the project (I will only explain the mathematics and the logic behind, for the code, take a look at the main.py) 
# Set up
1. In every machine learning, you will first have to collect a set of data (you can download the "hours_vs_scores.csv" file and use it as your training data set). The file of data is going to be saved under the form of csv. what is csv file: https://allthings.how/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-to-open-or-create-it/ (Check this link out to know what the csv file is)
2. Now that you have the dataset downloaded, create a folder where you want to save your project, and move that csv file into the folder. Next, create the python file, you can name it anyways you want .py (This is where all the code will be in)
