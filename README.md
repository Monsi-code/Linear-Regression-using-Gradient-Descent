# Linear-Regression-using-Gradient-Descent
Assuming that you have a set of data going on, and you want to build the machine that look into the data, plotting it on the graph, and then drawing a function that will further predict the value of the data is going to be.

We are going to perform this using pre-knowledge like: y = mx+b, and gradient descent

# The tutorial for the project (I will only explain the mathematics and the logic behind, for the code, take a look at the main.py) 
# Set up
1. In every machine learning, you will first have to collect a set of data (you can download the "hours_vs_scores.csv" file and use it as your training data set). The file of data is going to be saved under the form of csv. what is csv file: https://allthings.how/what-is-a-csv-file-and-how-to-open-or-create-it/ (Check this link out to know what the csv file is)
2. Now that you have the dataset downloaded, create a folder where you want to save your project, and move that csv file into the folder. Next, create the python file, you can name it anyways you want .py (This is where all the code will be in)

# Installing required libraries and modules
1. First of all, make sure you install and import all the necessaries modules and libraries that we will work with including: pandas, matplotlib, numpy.
    1. Pandas: an open-source Python library designed to manipulate and working with data. In our case, we will use it to access our data file in the python script. (https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/index.html#getting-started)
    2. Matplotlib: Using for data visualization. Imagine this, you have a set of datas in number, now you want to create the graph and plot those data on the graph --> This is where Matplotlib comes in, it helps you to actually visualize the data and see what is actually going on instead of just reading those boring numbers. (https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/index.html)
    3. numpy: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/index.html#user

4. For installation instruction: (make sure you take a look at what version does the modules or library support with your python, usually mentioning at the top of the page)
   1. Pandas: https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/install.html
   2. matplotlib: https://matplotlib.org/stable/install/index.html
   3. numpy: https://numpy.org/install/

# Coding
1. In order to access those libraries earlier in the python script, you will need to import those in your scrip (look at main.py)
2. After importing all the libraries and modules, now you have to give python script access to your data_set.csv (look at main.py)
3.
